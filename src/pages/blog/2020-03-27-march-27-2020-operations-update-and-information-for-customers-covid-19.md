   OPERATIONS UPDATE AND INFORMATION FOR CUSTOMERS- COVID 19 
  April 2020 Bills
---
We are continuing to respond and take necessary actions and precautions to defeat the spread of the COVID-19 Pandemic.  We have always been and remain committed to provide our community with water and have taken actions necessary to protect our staff and insure that we are operating efficiently and effectively.  Our priority at this time is to keep our staff safe and well so we can continue providing water to our service area. 

This information is to provide a safety update for our Customers, and to provide guidance to our customers concerning payment of April 2020 bills. 

This is effective Friday, March 27, 2020 until further notice. 

1.	Billing Update: April Bills were mailed out on Wednesday, March 25, 2020.  Customers should expect to receive bills between March 27-31,2020, but customers may also experience and expect delays with the postal service during this time. 



2.	Late Fees: There will be NO Late Fees applied in the Month of April.  This does not relieve any future late fees that may be incurred once the Pandemic has ended. 



3.	Disconnection for Non-Payment: There will be NO DISCONNECTION in the Month of April.  This does not relieve the responsibility to pay the bill, and does not relieve any possible future disconnection for non-payment of these bills once the Pandemic has ended. We will be glad to work with customers who may need a Payment agreement for hardship as we always do once the Pandemic has ended.



4.	IMPORTANT: We ask that if you are sick, coughing, or running a fever, that you DO NOT use the Drive Thru or Night Deposit Box.  We ask that you ONLY make your payment by Phone or by using our online bill payment system at https://portal.utilitydistrict.com/3529 . Please remember that there are no late fees and no disconnections in April, so we ask that you stay safe, get well, and pay your bill when you can safely do so.  This is for your well-being and the safety of our staff. 



5.	Our Office Remains Open: We are taking Phone Calls and our DRIVE-THRU is open. Our office hours are Monday- Friday, 7:30am-4:30 pm.  Our office can assist you with anything you may need, via telephone or by coming through our drive thru.  



6.	Payments: We ask that customers consider paying their bills with the following options that eliminate person to person contact: 

a.	Online at https://portal.utilitydistrict.com/3529 

b.	FCWA Advisory APP â€“ Free Download through the Apple or Android Stores. 

c.	Pay via Telephone by calling the office during Normal Business Hours. 

d.	Mail your Bill to FCWA, PO Box 327, Flemingsburg, KY 41041.

e.	Drop off your bill in our Night Deposit Box, located in our Drive Thru area 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. 

7.	New Meter Accounts: Please call ahead and speak with our staff if you are looking to purchase a new meter, or switch a meter account from one owner to another.  Calling ahead will allow us to get the necessary paper work ready for your signature once you arrive.  

We will continue to post updates as needed to our Website, FCWA Advisory APP, and Facebook Page.  

If you have any questions or concerns, please call our office at 606-845-3981.
